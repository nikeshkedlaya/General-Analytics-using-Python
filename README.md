# General Analytics

In this project, i have used students marks, Observation and Compliment data.

Marks : Academic marks for the student

Observation : Teacher makes observation on student 

Compliment : Teacher gives compliment for a student 

Based on the above dataset, we can suggest good characteristics which hightest scored students got from teacher to those who got less marks. This helps in how we can easily code python for small scale analytics.
