# General Analytics

In this project, i have used students marks, Observation and Compliment data.

Marks : Academic marks of students

Observation : Teacher makes observation on students 

Compliment : Teacher gives compliment to students

Based on the above dataset, we can suggest good characteristics which hightest scored students got from teacher to those who got less marks. This helps in how we can easily code python for small scale analytics.
